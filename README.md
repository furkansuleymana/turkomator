# turkomator
a simple turkish dictionary app with jetpack compose

this project is mainly done for learning purposes, so it may contain lots of bad/worst practices.
<br />
it uses the new api from sozluk.gov.tr to parses the word and it's meaning(s) and other data provided by the api.
<br />
hopefully it'll have other features too. we'll see.
